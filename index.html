            <h4>
                African Salad (locally known as Abacha) is one of the meals that mostly prepared and enjoyed by the -ibo speaking people of Nigeria. Its native taste is so distinctive, making it a delicacy to be enjoyed by all. It is usually served as a side dish in special events such as traditional weddings, burial ceremonies, anniversaries or the visit of a special guest. It is best served with Palm wine, a local drink tapped from special palm trees, but you can also enjoy it with any chilled drink of choice.
